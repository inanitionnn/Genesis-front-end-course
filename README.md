## Notes

- I solved the problem with —Åors through a proxy. (not sure how correct this is, but it works)
- I tried to experiment with the API, I tried the limit, page and count options to upload courses for each page separately. I didn't succeed. So I wrote only the pagination of already downloaded courses
- Didn`t have time to implement the token (auth) middleware
- Didn`t have time to develop the saving of the progress of videos and lessons
